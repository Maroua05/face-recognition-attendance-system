What is face recognition and detection?
It works by identifying and measuring facial features in an image. Facial recognition can identify human faces in images or videos, determine if the face in two images
belongs to the same person, or search for a face among a large collection of existing images.

Face Recognition library:
The library can compare different faces, returning the degree of likeness. This allows identifying human faces appearing in still images or video streams by looking up
face databases. Recognizing and identifying still images enables locating similar faces in driverâ€™s license databases while helping detect duplicates. 
The system implements image indexing, creating compact templates for faster searching. This in turn allows building a range of security applications such as
video surveillance and real-time access control systems. 
Many more features and higher performance are achievable in video-based surveillance systems using the new set of motion-based recognition algorithms.

What is dlib library in Python?
Dlib is one of the most powerful and easy-to-go open-source library consisting of machine learning library/algorithms and various tools for creating software.

What OpenCV is used for?
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure
for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
